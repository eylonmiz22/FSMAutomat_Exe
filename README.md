## Description: ##
This repository represents the course in the subject of models of computation. The assignments of this course refer to the implementations of different algorithms regarding automated machines.

The repository contains DFSM and NDFSM classes and their relevant subclasses and:
1. Calculates the boolean value ("Accept/Reject") of the given automat on a given string.
2. Generates DFSM object from a given FSM object.

## Requirements: ##
1. It is necessary to add the jar files "Assignment3" and "Submission" to the project HW2_206125411.
2. It is necessary to link the two projects HW2_206125411 and FSM.
